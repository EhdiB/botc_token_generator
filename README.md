## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment
Option A: Using setup.sh Script (Recommended)
We have a simple setup.sh script that automates setting up the virtual environment and installing dependencies. To use it:

Make sure the script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

Run the setup.sh script:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script will:
- Create a virtual environment called myenv.
- Activate the environment.
- Install dependencies from requirements.txt.


Option B: Manually Using virtualenv
If you prefer to set up the environment manually, you can follow these steps:

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```
Activate the virtual environment:

Linux/Mac: source myenv/bin/activate
Windows: .\myenv\Scripts\activate
Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application
After setting up the environment and installing dependencies, start the application:

```bash
python programtorun.py
```
